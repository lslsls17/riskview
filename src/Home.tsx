        Do you get prepared for a black-swan event like COVID-19 or 2008
        Financial Crisis? Do you know how big is the drawdown can hit your
        portfolio? Do you know how fast is recovery? Let me tell you assuming
        you are in these tough days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investment is all about practice, patience and persistence. I hope the
        tool can warn you on your risk when things are good and encourage you
        when the days are tough.
